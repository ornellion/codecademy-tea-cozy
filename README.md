Codecademy Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy completed as part of the "Layout with Flexbox" unit. 

**Project specification**

_In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer._

_We will provide a [design spec](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg?_gl=1*onjerh*_ga*MDE0Njc4OTczOC4xNzAxMTk5NjAw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcxMDAxODMwOS45Ny4xLjE3MTAwMTg0MTYuMC4wLjA.) and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance._

**Verdict**: Close enough ðŸ’ª
